# Protien-Sequence-Analyzer

1) Visit NCBI website.
2) Search for Nucleotide sequence that you want to analyze. For ex, we are searching for RAS1 which is a nucleotide sequence for Yeast cell during spore formation.
3) after the search result appears, select the Nucleotide option.
4) Now convert this in a text file and name it with a .fasta extention.
5) now you can run the code by using the following steps as follows:-
6) in the output you have to give the full path address of the file. In this case the file is in the current directory that's why path is "./RAS1.fasta".
7) the result is generated.
